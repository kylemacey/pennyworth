# pennyworth

## Summary

Pennyworth is designed to be a Chrome Extension that will allow quick jumping to GitHub entities such as Users, Organizations, Repositories, Issues, and Pull Requests. It is also designed to make it easy to search GitHub and Repositories.

## Name

Since this extension was inspired by some [Alfred Workflows](http://www.packal.org/search/site/Github), I decided to take the last name from the DC Butler who [shares the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Pennyworth).
